[63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        dp = new int[m][n];
        for(int i = 0;i<m;i++) Arrays.fill(dp[i],-1);
        return dfs(0,0,m,n,obstacleGrid);

    }
    int [][] dp;
    int dfs(int x, int y, int m, int n, int[][]obstacleGrid){
        //如果说遇到障碍物就返回 0
        if(x == m || y == n || obstacleGrid[x][y] == 1 ) return 0;
        if(x == m-1 && y == n-1)return 1;
        if(dp[x][y]!=-1) return dp[x][y];
        return  dp[x][y]=dfs(x+1,y,m,n,obstacleGrid) + dfs(x,y+1,m,n,obstacleGrid);

    }
}
```
